# File-Hasher
Takes a file path as input and generates a hash of the file using the md5sum or sha256sum tool.

To use the script, save it to a file (e.g. file-hasher.sh) and make it executable using chmod +x file-hasher.sh. Then, run the script using the command ./file-hasher.sh. The script will prompt you for the file path to hash and the hash type to use (md5 or sha256). The script will then generate the hash of the file and display it. Note that the md5sum and sha256sum tools must be installed on your system for the script to work.
